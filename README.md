For this project, I added a real kernel thread to xv6. I divided the description of this project into three parts. In the first part, I defined a new system call to create the kernel threads and named it 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑒 (). Second, I used 𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑛𝑒 () system call to create a little thread library. And in the last part, using a test program, I showed the correctness of my changes. You can find the detailed description of the project in the Report.pdf file.
